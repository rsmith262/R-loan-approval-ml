# Loan Approval Prediction

This project analyses a real-world loan approval dataset using R. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the development of machine learning models (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest) to predict loan approvals. Data imbalance was handled with SMOTE, and models were evaluated using Accuracy, F1 Score, and AUC-ROC metrics.

- **CW1:** Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- **CW2:** Model training and evaluation
